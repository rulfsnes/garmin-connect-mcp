## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Garmin Connect Account**: Active account with data from a compatible Garmin device
2. **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
3. **MCP Client**: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or another MCP-compatible application

### Installation

#### Option 1: Use with npx (Recommended)

No installation required! Configure directly in your MCP client:

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "garmin-connect-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code**:

Using the Claude Code CLI (recommended):
```bash
claude mcp add garmin-connect npx garmin-connect-mcp@latest \
  --env GARMIN_USERNAME=your_username \
  --env GARMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Or manually configure (`.claude/mcp.json` in your project):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "garmin-connect-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `-y` flag automatically accepts the npx prompt, ensuring smooth startup.

#### Option 2: Global Installation

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g garmin-connect-mcp@latest
```

Then configure without npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "garmin-connect-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Local Development

For development or testing local changes:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd garmin-connect-mcp
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Configure with absolute path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or use a `.env` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "envFile": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-mcp/.env"
    }
  }
}
```

### Workout Planning
```
Create a 5x1000m interval workout and schedule it for Tuesday
Build a strength workout with squats, bench press, and planks

```

## Advanced Features

### Pagination
For large activity lists, use pagination:
```javascript
// Get activities 0-49
get_activities({ start: 0, limit: 50 })

// Get activities 50-99
get_activities({ start: 50, limit: 50 })
```

### Activity Type Filtering
Filter training volume by specific sports:
```javascript
get_weekly_volume({
  activityTypes: ['running', 'cycling'],
  includeTrends: true
})
```

### Trend Analysis
Compare periods to track progress:
```javascript
// Week-over-week comparison
get_weekly_volume({ includeTrends: true })

// Month-over-month comparison
get_monthly_volume({ includeTrends: true })
```

### Summary vs Detailed Modes
Control response size and detail level:
```javascript
// Quick summary
get_sleep_data({ summary: true })

// Full detailed breakdown with time-series
get_sleep_data({ summary: false })
```

### Response Size Management
The server automatically validates response sizes and provides fallback summaries if data exceeds limits. For large date ranges, consider:
- Using `summary: true` mode
- Filtering by specific activity types
- Reducing date ranges
- Disabling detailed breakdowns

## Security

### Credential Management

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use environment variables for credentials
- ✅ Use `.env` files (ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Use MCP configuration `env` or `envFile` options
- ❌ Never hardcode credentials in configuration files
- ❌ Never commit credentials to version control

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
GARMIN_USERNAME=your_username
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Testing Locally

For local development, use `.mcp.json` (gitignored):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
      "envFile": ".env"
    }
  }
}
```

### API Rate Limits

The server includes automatic rate limiting and error handling for Garmin Connect API:
- Small delays between batch requests (100ms)
- Graceful error handling for failed requests
- Maximum activity limits to prevent overwhelming the API

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failed**
- Verify credentials in `.env` file
- Check that MCP configuration points to correct `.env` or has correct `env` values
- Ensure Garmin account is active and accessible

**No Data Returned**
- Verify your Garmin device has synced recently
- Check that you're querying dates with actual data
- Ensure your Garmin account has the requested data types

**Response Too Large**
- Use `summary: true` for condensed results
- Reduce date ranges for volume queries
- Filter by specific activity types
- Disable detailed breakdowns (`includeActivityBreakdown: false`)

**Server Not Starting**
- Ensure Node.js version is 20 or higher
- Run `pnpm build` to rebuild after changes
- Check server logs for authentication errors

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- All tests pass (`pnpm test:run`)
- Type checking passes (`pnpm typecheck`)
- Code follows existing style guidelines
- New features include tests
